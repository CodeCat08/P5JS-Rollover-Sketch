This program demonstrates conditional logic (if, else, true, false). If the mouse is within the drawn rectangle, the rectangle is filled with a color. If the user presses the primary mouse button while the cursor is located inside the rectangle, the rectangle's color is changed to a random color.

## How to use:
  - Press the primary button while hovering the cursor inside the rectangle to change its color!
